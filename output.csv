Great highlights package and good comms
What stamina strength and skills of riders ‚ù§
"I think the TT is going to be pivotal, because who wins really lays out the final week tactics for Pog and Jonas.

If Jonas puts time into Pog, then he has to do nothing but follow, follow, follow. If Pog puts time into Jonas and takes Yellow, all he has to do is follow, follow, follow and sprint to beat him for any time bonuses.

All of that being said, Jonas looked to be great and didn't seem to be dropping off at all, Pog begun to look a little tired, especially on the last stage before rest day. As stated TT I think is key, because it sets out team tactics for the big 2000m climb later in week, which over last two years has proven to be where Jonas has the slight advantage.

Still incredible that after 2 weeks of racing the gap is 10 seconds. Also shows just how far ahead these two are from rest of peloton."
"how are there highlights of a biycle man, they do one thing until they crash, boring"
Epic!
What a Tour!!
Crazy stages!
I would not be surprised if these two get the same time on the individual time trial üòÇ
It was a CRAZY EXCITING week. Looking forward to the final days B)
