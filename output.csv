Rødgrød Med Fløde to all who scrolls back up and gives the video a like
Unexpected? He joined Jumbo and started eating their well balanced breakfast and take his vitamins
"All of Jumbo's bad luck made it inevitable for Jonas to win in 2022, let's see if karma goes his way again"
Dopas Vingejuice or Juicenas Dopingaard?
the reason why jonas was so behind in the race was because he waited multiple times on roglic when he crashed but he still managed to be right behind pogacar
Rasmus guldhammer who beat him in 2017 is my moms cousins man lol.😂
YOOOOOOOOOOO HE SAID VINGEGAARD CORRECTLY
Denmark
Doping
RIP Gino Mäder
''vindegaard''
who can't like joans and hwo can't like pog  and who can't love tour de france..
VINGEgaard*
Where's part 2 and the link to Jumbo-Vismas videos that you talk about around 5:50?
Actullay i am an dane and an jumbo visma fan from Thisted 😂😂
You are not doing Jonas Vingegaard any favors by comparing him to the cheater Michael Rasmussen...
A very well produced video. I think Jonas can win TDF again .
I like both Jonas and Pog and don't have a strong preference. Part of me feels like Pog is generally the strongest individual and I want to root for him because Jonas probably has the best team in the world helping him... but it's hard not to like Jonas.
"Sorry to say, even if it means Jonas not will win this year, Rosa his mother-in-law, did not win the Danish bake-off, she was just a very likable character in the program"
Its vingegaard not vindegaard
"I live in Denmark and I had never head of Jonas Vingegaards mother-in-law until he won the Tour de France, so if she is very famous in Denmark then I missed something and I still don't know her name. I think that only the people watching the baking program knew of her."
You need to do more investigation. The “J” in the team name is silent and he is not married to his girlfriend so he doesn’t have a mother in law
"The link you mentioned about Jumbo Visma documentary, where can i find that? :)"
"love how you call him ""Vindegaard"" instead of Vingegaard (Vinde in danish means Winning) thats alsoe what we call him now in denmark ;p"
Jonas vinegard and Wout van Aert as green shirt and master helper gold combo !
Vinegar😑
Nothing is unspected when you have Bjarne Rijs and the former Rabobank with your team
Peds must be rife amongst all these way too young cyclists or must be mechanical aids!
"kinda expected rise of jonas vingegaard, with pogi's injury"
Pogi for 2023!
"it annoys me you're saying his middle name wrong ""Vindegaard"" its ""Vingegaard"""
Rest in peace Gino Maeder
RIP Gino Mader
I would have seen it if it was'nt for the music.
Jonas is a 1 trick pony
"Saying he did his job well as a domestique in the 2020 Vuelta for Roglic is underplaying it a fair bit. His performance that year is widely regarded as that of a super domestique; a performance that led several Danish pundits, biased as they are, to predict he'd be a GT factor in the future. Often out-riding Sepp Kuss, It was a mini break out for him that showed his super strength."
Great video('s)! Really enjoying this in the build-up towards the tdf 2023. An episode about Wout Van Aert would be awesome ;)!
I’m 🎉rooting for Jonas!  May the Danish talent reign!
Amazing! Definitely one of the best documentaries about Jonas that I've seen. Hopefully a lot of people are going to find this during the Tour!
"YES PLEASE, I was begging to god for this! <3"
Looking forward to the next episode... You have made one of the best documentaries about Jonas that I have seen so far. BTW where can I get my Rødgrød Med Fløde?
"How? You legit said ""Gaard"" perfectly... but you misspronounced ""Vinge"" so bad😂"
