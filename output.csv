"WvA ,je také teľiatko tupučké.Nikdy nebude majster sveta. This is monkey - Makak . Nie Peter Sagan . 3tims  MS."
amazing rider!
This guy just seems so cool.
he always be the coolest guy in any situation
Van Aert must be the greatest ever cyclist.
Stupid cyklist 👎😖
Vinegard did not want to pull because did not want to waste legs niether he could beat Pogacar hehehe he knows he's got to save every single drop of sweat hehehe
One of the greatest 1 day riders and 1 of the greatest tour riders that can win many green jerseys and yet they taking him for a fool like this
thanks aert
He should join another team and become team leader
Exactly most of the time it’s the media/journalists who are the drama lol
"Wout is a stellar dude and great cyclist, he should be team leader!"
I listen to Wout instead of the mad Belgian press.
"Wout the steamroller is a champion in his own right, period, love seeing him race & when she expresses his frustration too😂"
Let's G💥
More self control?
"Tour de France unchained was cool, but really feels like they are trying to create controversy and portray some riders in a certain way (like they did in Drive to survive). It's somewhat good for the sport to get more attention, but I hope it doesn't become a fake soap opera...🙈"
The atmosphere is great. Yeahh…
"Ok, now it's clear which reporters are attempting to create controversy between Wout and Jonas. ""Is it all the media, the journalists, the hype, or is there something brewing?""
The title of another Flobikes video has the word 'Selfish?'
and pictures Jonas. What are you trying to achieve?"
"& yet all those who could only see friction in the team after yesterday's stage, how wrong you all were.

I've personally been on the receiving end & what the fans & media make up sometimes is more their own state of minds, than what's really going on, or not going on it 'Le Tour'
Enjoy the race & encourage the riders, all riders. They don't want to read or hear about made up journalism, just to finish a three week Tour is a huge accomplishment in itself. They need to focus fully to do that."
If all professionals behaved with as much dignity and sportsmanship as WvA….
No more live in Canada? Only stages 1 and 2?
"Making something out of nothing, he was surprised that guy beat him!"
